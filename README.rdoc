= Redmine RE

The Redmine RE plugin (http://redmine-re.korem.de) is a requirements engineering and requirements management plugin for the Redmine (http://redmine.org) project management software. The Redmine RE plugin's goal is to enable its users to create a requirements specification directly in Redmine. Users can create requirement artifacts view, store, edit and discuss these artifacts directly in Redmine.

A per project Requirements Tab gives users access to their specification. They can interconnect (trace) requirement artifacts to other artifacts as well as issues. Try the plugin here http://redmine-re.korem.de and discover more features like commenting on requirements or visualizing traces.

Redmine RE is compatible with Redmine Versions 2.4 and higher.
